# Color Guessing Game

## About
Guess the RGB color game is a an app built with vanilla JavaScript (ECMAScript 6), HTML5 and CSS3. The purpose is to figure out what color does the RGB code in the header is referring to. It's a great practice for learning RGB colors. I plan to add a timer to it to make it a bit more challenging.
